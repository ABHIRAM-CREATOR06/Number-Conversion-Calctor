# Multi-Dimensional Calculator
## Decimal Conversion

This Rust project demonstrates how to perform number conversions with decimal points using a user-defined module. The project uses the `rust_decimal` crate for high-precision decimal arithmetic.
- Conversion from base to another with a accuracy upto a base of of 32 [for high accuracy] 

## Area Calculator
This rust project was upgraded with ability to calculate areas of:-
- Square
- Rectangle
- Triangle
- Circle
- Regular polygon with n side

and ability to convert into various units.

## Temperature Convertor
A ability to convert from temperatures units of celcius,fahrenheit,kelvin,rankine fom one another.
-  Also it can convert from one unit to another with a accuracy upto 4 decimal places.

## Lenght Convertor
This project was upgraded with ability to convert from length units of meter,centimeter,inch,foot,yard,mile.

## Physics Calculator
this project was upgraded with ability to calculate:-
- mass
- foce
- energy
- velocity
- pressure
- acceleration
- volume

and  ability to convert into various units.

## Miscellaneous Operation
- Angle operations
- Data Transfer unis
- Fuel Economy units

## Time Operation
-  Time conversion from one unit to another
- Time calculation of time difference between two time
- Calculate effiency of a work

## Fuel Calculations
- Get ideas about efficiency
- get knowledge about environmental issues like carbon footprint
- Annual Fuel Cost
- Fuel consumptions
- Monthly savings when buying a new car

## Data Transfer
- Converting into various bases
- Network Speed predictor
- Network Statistics
