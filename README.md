# Multi-Dimensional Convertor
## Decimal Conversion

This Rust project demonstrates how to perform number conversions with decimal points using a user-defined module. The project uses the `rust_decimal` crate for high-precision decimal arithmetic.
- Conversion from base to another with a accuracy upto a base of of 32 [for high accuracy] 

## Area Calculator
This rust project was upgraded with ability to calculate areas of:-
- Square
- Rectangle
- Triangle
- Circle
- Regular polygon with n side

and ability to convert into various units.

## Temperature Convertor
A ability to convert from temperatures units of celcius,fahrenheit,kelvin,rankine fom one another.
-  Also it can convert from one unit to another with a accuracy upto 4 decimal places.

## Lenght Convertor
This project was upgraded with ability to convert from length units of meter,centimeter,inch,foot,yard,mile.

## Physics Calculator
this project was upgraded with ability to calculate:-
- mass
- foce
- energy
- velocity
- pressure
- acceleration
- volume

Conversion to other bases would be added soon

## Project Structure

- `src/`
  - `main.rs`: The main entry point of the application.
  - `arithmetic.rs`: A module containing functions for arithmetic operations.
  - `area.rs`: A module containing functions for area calculations.

## Dependencies

- `rust_decimal`: A crate for high-precision decimal arithmetic.
- `rust_decimal_macros`: A crate for creating decimal literals.

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
rust_decimal = "1.36"
rust_decimal_macros = "1.36"
```

#### Please adhere to this project's `code of conduct`and support the developer with a follow and star.
#### Devolopment process of time,fuel,economy,angle, data size modules are planned and would be added after development and testing.
